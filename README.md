- You will be building a Red bus Frontend Clone project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- In the end, we will have a frontend application in which you can enter your source and destination and then select from a variety of buses available.
- You would be able to book a seat, filter results based on price, departure time, arrival time and rating.
- The two API we are going to use in this project to fetch the bus data is [`https://content.newtonschool.co/v1/pr/63b70222af4f30335b4b3b9a/buses?source=delhi&destination=jaipur`](https://content.newtonschool.co/v1/pr/63b70222af4f30335b4b3b9a/buses?source=delhi&destination=jaipur) and this [`https://content.newtonschool.co/v1/pr/63b70222af4f30335b4b3b9a/buses`](https://content.newtonschool.co/v1/pr/63b70222af4f30335b4b3b9a/buses)
- The second API contains all the data of the buses in it which we will use on the bus List page.
- The first API have some extra text appended to it which contains `source` and `destination` and it will give data of those buses which have same source and destination as mentioned in URL.
